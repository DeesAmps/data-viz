This project is a full-stack interactive data visualization dashboard for COVID-19 data. It uses React (Vite, TypeScript) for the frontend and Python/Flask for the backend. The backend will handle data normalization and API endpoints, and PostgreSQL will be used for data storage. Features include dynamic filters, cross-chart brushing, time-series playback, CSV/XLSX export, annotation layers, and OAuth2 authentication (GitHub/Google).
